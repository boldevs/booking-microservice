# JWT Best Practices and Recommendations

This document provides recommendations for improving the JWT (JSON Web Token) implementation in this project.

## 1. Re-evaluate the Use of Resource Owner Password Grant

The current implementation uses the **Resource Owner Password Credential (ROPC)** grant type (`grant_type=password`).

-   **Problem**: ROPC is **not recommended** for modern applications. It requires the client application (like a web or mobile app) to collect the user's username and password directly. This creates a large security risk because the user's credentials are exposed to the client application, increasing the attack surface. It also breaks single sign-on (SSO) capabilities.

-   **Recommendation**: Migrate to a more secure OAuth 2.1 flow.
    -   For **Web Applications (SPAs)** and **Mobile Apps**, use the **Authorization Code Flow with PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange)**. This flow is more secure as it never exposes user credentials to the application. The user logs in directly with the authorization server.
    -   For **service-to-service** communication where no user is present, use the **Client Credentials** grant type.

## 2. Secure Storage for Client Secrets

Currently, the client secret is hardcoded in `Identity/Config.cs`:

```csharp
new Secret("secret".Sha256())
